## About This Project

This website, including its design, development, and code, was entirely created on a voluntary basis by a first-year undergraduate student at Université Paris Dauphine. It serves as a platform to present the research and findings of Master’s students in Marketing and Strategy regarding the future of the cultivated meat industry in France.

## The Master's Project

This project is led by a group of Master’s students from Université Paris Dauphine, specializing in Marketing and Strategy. Through this website, they strive to answer the question: "What is the future of the cultivated meat industry in France?"

To do so, they have conducted in-depth research on the key players in this sector, their sometimes contrasting perspectives, and the different possible scenarios. Their goal is to present their findings in an engaging and accessible manner so that everyone can form their own opinion based on the collected data.

Happy reading!
